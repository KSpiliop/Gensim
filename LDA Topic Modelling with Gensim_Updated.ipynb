LMP measures cover primarily interventions that provide temporary support for groups that are disadvantaged in the labour market (unemployed, employed at risk, and inactive persons). LMP measures are classified by type of action and cover the following categories: training, job rotation and job sharing, employment incentives, supported employment and rehabilitation, direct job creation, and start-up incentives. Data on participants in LMP measures are defined as the stock of participants in regular activation measures (LMP categories 2-7) divided by the number of persons wanting to work.   ']\n"
